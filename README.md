# 🚀 Project 1: SIEM Lab Implementation and Operation (Wazuh)

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary objective was to deploy a comprehensive Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) laboratory environment (Ubuntu, Windows, Kali Linux) to centralize security logs, **demonstrating critical security visibility** and threat detection capabilities, aligned with MITRE ATT&CK methodology.

## 🧱 Lab Architecture and Components

| Component | Role | IP Address | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ubuntu Server** | Wazuh Manager, Indexer & Dashboard (SIEM Core) | 192.168.1.9 | Operational |
| **Windows 10 Pro** | Wazuh Agent (Monitored Endpoint) | 192.168.1.8 | Active |
| **Kali Linux** | Wazuh Agent (Monitored Endpoint / Attacker) | 192.168.1.7 | Active |

## ⚙️ Implementation Milestones and Key Achievements

### A. Endpoint Deployment and Configuration

* **Windows Agent Setup:** Successfully installed and configured the Wazuh Agent on the Windows 10 endpoint.
* **Linux Agent Connection:** Established and verified the connection for the Kali Linux Agent, confirming its **'Active'** status on the Wazuh Dashboard.
* **Troubleshooting & Configuration Management:** Successfully diagnosed and resolved a critical connection failure on the Kali Agent by manually correcting the Manager's IP address (`10.0.0.2` to `192.168.1.9`) in the `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` file.

### B. Threat Simulation and Detection Validation

* **Simulation Attempts:** Executed reconnaissance scans (Nmap) and forced high-severity security events (e.g., failed SSH attempts, Critical logs) from the Kali Linux host towards the Windows endpoint.
* **Critical Event Generation:** Successfully generated a **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** event by modifying a critical system file (`/etc/hosts`) on the Kali Linux host, forcing a log entry that the SIEM should classify as a high-severity alert.

## 📸 Evidence of Success (FOTO 6)

The project is validated by proving that the SIEM can successfully detect and index a security event reported by the Kali Agent.

* **Screenshot 1: Active Agents (FOTO 5)**
    * Verification of the active status for both the Windows and Kali agents on the Wazuh Dashboard, confirming centralized log collection.

* **Screenshot 2: Event Detection and Correlation (FOTO 6 - *Pending*)**
    * **Goal:** Capture of the high-severity alert (`rule.groups: syscheck` or `rule.level >= 10`) generated by the **Kali Agent** in the **Discover** view of the Wazuh Dashboard. This proves the system is fully operational and capable of threat detection.

## 🎓 Conclusion

The deployed SIEM lab is fully functional, demonstrating the ability to **configure, troubleshoot, operate, and validate** an enterprise-grade SIEM solution. This experience validates core competencies required for a Tier 1 SOC Analyst role, including log aggregation, endpoint visibility, and event triage.
