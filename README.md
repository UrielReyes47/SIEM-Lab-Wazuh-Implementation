# 🚀 Project 1: SIEM Lab Implementation and Operation (Wazuh/Kibana)

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary objective was to deploy a comprehensive Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) laboratory environment (Ubuntu, Windows, Kali Linux) to centralize security logs, **demonstrating critical security visibility** and threat detection capabilities, aligning with MITRE ATT&CK methodology.

## 🧱 Lab Architecture and Components

| Component | Role | IP Address | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ubuntu Server** | Wazuh Manager, Indexer & Dashboard (SIEM Core) | 192.168.1.9 | Operational |
| **Windows 10 Pro** | Wazuh Agent (Monitored Endpoint) | 192.168.1.8 | Active |
| **Kali Linux** | Wazuh Agent (Monitored Endpoint / Attacker) | 192.168.1.7 | Active |

## ⚙️ Implementation Milestones and Key Achievements

### A. Endpoint Deployment and Configuration

* **Agent Deployment Configuration (Photo A):** Initiated the Windows Agent deployment by configuring the server address to the Wazuh Manager's IP (`192.168.1.9`) and executing the installation via PowerShell.

* **Initial Agent Status (Photo B):** The Wazuh Dashboard confirms the Windows Agent (`001`) is **'active'**, while the Kali Agent (`002`) initially showed **'never connected'**, indicating a configuration issue that required troubleshooting.

* **Configuration Fault Identification (Photo C):** Accessed the Kali Agent's configuration file (`/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`) and confirmed a critical error: the server IP was incorrectly set to `10.0.0.2`, preventing communication with the Manager.

* **Troubleshooting and Authentication Success (Photo D):** Corrected the server IP to `192.168.1.9` and executed `/var/ossec/bin/agent-auth`. The terminal confirmed the successful re-authentication with the message: **"Valid key received"**. This demonstrated a key troubleshooting skill.

* **Active Agents (Photo 5):** The final Dashboard view validates that both agents, Windows (`001`) and Kali (`002`), are **active** and successfully reporting to the SIEM.

### B. Threat Simulation and SOC Analyst Skills

* **Reconnaissance Simulation:** Executed an Nmap port scan from Kali (`nmap -sT 192.168.1.8`). This test was followed by a network check which showed **100% packet loss** when pinging the Windows host, confirming a network barrier or firewall was active.

* **Advanced Filtering (SOC Skill):** Demonstrated proficiency in using the Wazuh Dashboard's Discover module to locate specific security events by applying precise filters on event fields such as:
    * **Agent Name** (`agent.name: Kali`).
    * **Rule Groups** (`rule.groups: syscheck`).
    * **Numerical Operators** (`is between` for `rule.level` 10 to 16).

## 📸 Evidence of Detection (FOTO 6 - *Pending*)

* **Goal:** The final piece of evidence is a screenshot showing that the SIEM successfully detected and indexed an event sent from the Kali or Windows endpoint, proving the end-to-end functionality of the system.
    
    * **Requirement:** Capture of the **Discover** view showing an alert (FIM or Critical log) generated by one of the active agents.

*(**Insert FOTO 6 here once the event appears in Discover**)*
